This notebook implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. The primary goal is to classify images of shoes into three distinct brands: Adidas, Converse, and Nike.

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains images of Adidas, Converse, and Nike shoes. It's ideal for multiclass image classification.
